# Final Capstone Front-End | Gourmet Experience App<a name="about-project"></a>

This project consists of a web application built with ReactJS and Redux Toolkit that allows users to book gourmet experiences that they can give to others, in a quick and easy way.

This application connects to the [GourmetExperience API](https://github.com/HFG43/final_capstone_back_end) and obtains all the information of registered users, the list of available gastronomic experiences, the list of reservations made by a selected user, and allows new users to be registered, authenticate existing users, create new reservations and delete them. Likewise, the app is completely responsive and has been built following the best practices of software development. It has robust validations, efficient data management, and a set of unit and integration tests that allowed validating the operation of the entire application.

```sh
  npm install
```

All the packages and libraries necessary for the project to work will be installed in a folder called /node_module. After finishing the installation of this project, you should verify that you have the [Final Capstone Back-End](https://github.com/HFG43/final_capstone_back_end) installed so that this project can work as expected.

### Usage

**IMPORTANT NOTE: As specified above, to run this project you must have the [Final Capstone Back-End](https://github.com/HFG43/final_capstone_back_end) project installed and running, since it contains the API that will be consuming in this project. Please do not run this project without first running the project mentioned previously.**

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`

A message similar to this will be displayed in the console:
![Alt text](<https://i.postimg.cc/bYG2n0R0/frontend-server.png>)

When the above message appears, press the `Y` key to allow the server to run the application on another available port (usually port 3001).

When everything is ready, this message should appear in the console:
- `compiled successfully!`

Open the main URL: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to see the app running in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

You may also see any CSS and JS linters errors in the console running the following commands:

CSS Linter

```sh
  npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
```

Javascript Linter

```sh
  npx eslint "**/*.{js,jsx}"
```

### Testing

Run the following command to verify the quality of the application code through the designed test cases:

```sh
  npm test
```

### Build

- `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

Your app is ready to be deployed!

**Note**: Please only modify the components files and the CSS files. Do not modify configurations files of the project.
